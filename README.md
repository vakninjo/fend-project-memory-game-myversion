## How to play

Select a card by clicking on it. Once clicked the card will flip over and you will need to select another card. If it does not match, remember the cards for the next match attempt. After matching all the cards you will be scored based on the amount of moves you made. Try to match all the cards in the least amount of moves.

Good luck and have fun!
